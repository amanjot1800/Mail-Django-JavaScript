# Mail-Django-JavaScript
This is a Single Page Application that allows users to send mails to other users of the app. They have different mailboxes such as inbox, sent, and archived. Users can send mail through a web form. Application also keeps track of read and unread emails.

JavaScript is used to make API calls to backend to send and request email information. It is also used to dynamically render webpages when user interacts with different parts of the app.

Django is responsible for filtering, sorting emails and sending request to front end. It also saves and fetches emails to and from a local database.
